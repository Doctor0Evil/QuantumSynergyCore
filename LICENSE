_for aln-quantumsynergy-pos-vm-amazon_

## 1. Preamble

This software is part of an ecosafety-oriented financial infrastructure stack designed for sub-cent USD rails, AugFingerprint-aware payments, and organically-integrated augmented citizen support within smart-city and Phoenix-style corridors. It is intended to be used only in deployments that uphold neurorights, data sovereignty, non-exclusion from basics, and ecosafety constraints expressed through KER (Knowledge, Eco-impact, Risk-of-harm) scoring and Rust/ALN guard invariants. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/2b3ead16-b34a-45d7-9eea-8e1cb885eb03/biopay-the-biophysical-mop-exp-UtzbIXCLSXOM6UHrmq0w2w.md)

[ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/aa86b258-b7b8-4706-91a0-cfcd39337400/paycomp-as-an-ecosafety-archit-fmuCjSjsR6CkVp35gb5Wuw.md)

These rights are granted on a per-deployment basis and can be revoked for non-compliant deployments as described in Section 9.

## 4. Ecosafety and KER Governance Requirements

Any deployment of this software (or derivatives) that handles real users, real funds, or real civic data MUST:

1. Implement qpudatashard-style ledgers or equivalent, with explicit KER fields (Knowledge, Eco-impact, Risk-of-harm) for relevant flows. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/aa86b258-b7b8-4706-91a0-cfcd39337400/paycomp-as-an-ecosafety-archit-fmuCjSjsR6CkVp35gb5Wuw.md)
2. Enforce Lyapunov-style “no unsafe transaction” invariants, such that residual risk-of-harm \( R_{t+1} \le R_t \) for admissible updates, encoded via Rust/ALN guard modules or equivalent formally checkable logic. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/aa86b258-b7b8-4706-91a0-cfcd39337400/paycomp-as-an-ecosafety-archit-fmuCjSjsR6CkVp35gb5Wuw.md)
3. Use integer microunits (e.g., \(0.001\) USD) or equivalent sub-cent precision where this software is used to process payments or credit flows, to prevent rounding leakage and hidden drift. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/2b3ead16-b34a-45d7-9eea-8e1cb885eb03/biopay-the-biophysical-mop-exp-UtzbIXCLSXOM6UHrmq0w2w.md)
4. Maintain open, auditable grammars for financial corridors, with “no corridor, no deployment” rules for products, pilots, or hardware nodes, enforced via CI and/or independent review. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/aa86b258-b7b8-4706-91a0-cfcd39337400/paycomp-as-an-ecosafety-archit-fmuCjSjsR6CkVp35gb5Wuw.md)

Deployments that disable or circumvent these constraints are not licensed under this agreement.

## 5. Neurorights, Non-Exclusion, and Augmented-Citizen Protections

Where this software is used in contexts involving organically-integrated augmented citizens, neuro-adjacent interfaces, or AugFingerprint-style payment features, the deployment MUST:

1. Recognize “organically-integrated augmented citizen” (or equivalent) as a protected capability class in its schemas and policies (e.g., via `austatus` fields or equivalent). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/ed4f83ec-69e0-49a7-aaaf-e1cfa60c76ef/what-else-can-we-learn-and-dis-nJPYJFfCR9mfpTpkwxv2qw.md)
2. Encode and enforce non-waivable rights flags equivalent to:

   - `noexclusionbasicservices = true` (no denial of ServiceClassBasic essentials solely due to augmentation, payment format, or neurorightssafe civic participation). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/2b3ead16-b34a-45d7-9eea-8e1cb885eb03/biopay-the-biophysical-mop-exp-UtzbIXCLSXOM6UHrmq0w2w.md)
   - `noneurocoercion = true` (no forced access to inner mental states or neural data as a condition for basics, safety, or legal recognition). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/ed4f83ec-69e0-49a7-aaaf-e1cfa60c76ef/what-else-can-we-learn-and-dis-nJPYJFfCR9mfpTpkwxv2qw.md)
   - `revocableatwill = true` (consent for telemetry or augmented capabilities is revocable without loss of basics). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/2b3ead16-b34a-45d7-9eea-8e1cb885eb03/biopay-the-biophysical-mop-exp-UtzbIXCLSXOM6UHrmq0w2w.md)
   - `noscorefrominnerstate = true` (no scoring or penalization based on inferred inner thoughts or feelings). [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/ed4f83ec-69e0-49a7-aaaf-e1cfa60c76ef/what-else-can-we-learn-and-dis-nJPYJFfCR9mfpTpkwxv2qw.md)

3. Treat internal biophysical or neural signals only as inputs to a rights-respecting AI companion or guard layer, never as raw signals exposed to merchants, employers, or states. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/2b3ead16-b34a-45d7-9eea-8e1cb885eb03/biopay-the-biophysical-mop-exp-UtzbIXCLSXOM6UHrmq0w2w.md)
4. Encode caps and corridors such as `maxpromptsperhour`, `maxdecisionsperhour`, `latencytolerancemsmax`, and “consent as corridor” rules, so that payment and consent prompts cannot be used to overload or coerce users. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/ed4f83ec-69e0-49a7-aaaf-e1cfa60c76ef/what-else-can-we-learn-and-dis-nJPYJFfCR9mfpTpkwxv2qw.md)

Any system that uses this software to build surveillance tools, coercive profiling, social-credit scoring, or exclusionary policies is expressly prohibited from doing so under this license.

## 6. Sub-Cent Credit Rails and Anti-Leakage Constraints

If this software is used to implement payment, settlement, or credit mechanisms:

1. Monetary units must be represented as scaled integers (e.g., mill-based `amount_mills`) to avoid floating-point rounding errors. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/aa86b258-b7b8-4706-91a0-cfcd39337400/paycomp-as-an-ecosafety-archit-fmuCjSjsR6CkVp35gb5Wuw.md)
2. Rounding residuals must be conserved and eventually credited back to the originating payer or to a clearly defined public-interest eco-account, never silently captured as untracked revenue. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/aa86b258-b7b8-4706-91a0-cfcd39337400/paycomp-as-an-ecosafety-archit-fmuCjSjsR6CkVp35gb5Wuw.md)
3. Loan and repayment schedules must avoid systematic over-collection caused by rounding biases, using the same sub-cent precision upheld in ledger operations. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/aa86b258-b7b8-4706-91a0-cfcd39337400/paycomp-as-an-ecosafety-archit-fmuCjSjsR6CkVp35gb5Wuw.md)

Use of this software to deliberately implement “rounding tax” patterns or hidden residual capture is prohibited.

## 7. Data Sovereignty, DID / Bostrom Anchoring, and Googolswarm

All telemetry, financial state, and consent state managed with this software MUST:

1. Be anchored to decentralized identifiers (DIDs), including Bostrom-style addresses where appropriate, under user- or institution-controlled keys. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/2b3ead16-b34a-45d7-9eea-8e1cb885eb03/biopay-the-biophysical-mop-exp-UtzbIXCLSXOM6UHrmq0w2w.md)
2. Use qpudatashards or equivalent DID-signed records as the primary log, with users retaining ownership and export rights to their own shards. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/ed4f83ec-69e0-49a7-aaaf-e1cfa60c76ef/what-else-can-we-learn-and-dis-nJPYJFfCR9mfpTpkwxv2qw.md)
3. Anchor critical manifests, metrics, and audit hashes into a tamper-resistant ledger (e.g., Googolswarm or equivalent), with multi-sig or similar mechanisms for governance attestation. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/2b3ead16-b34a-45d7-9eea-8e1cb885eb03/biopay-the-biophysical-mop-exp-UtzbIXCLSXOM6UHrmq0w2w.md)
4. Never treat biophysical or neural telemetry as a bearer key; credentials must be cryptographic and revocable without invasive changes to the body. [ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws](https://ppl-ai-file-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/web/direct-files/collection_b87dd20a-02c1-4c44-b3b5-e87ddc946bf8/ed4f83ec-69e0-49a7-aaaf-e1cfa60c76ef/what-else-can-we-learn-and-dis-nJPYJFfCR9mfpTpkwxv2qw.md)
